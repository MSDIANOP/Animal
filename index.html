  <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
  <P>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties,comopsition,and behaviour of matter.It is a fascinating field taht explores the building blocks of the universe.</P>
  <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
  <P>The <span style="background-color: yellow;">periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</P>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    
    <P>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction</i>.</P>
    
    <P>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</P>
    
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and oxygen gas (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub>O</i>).</p>
    
    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    
   <p> <dfn>Stoichiometry</dfn> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    
    <P>Subscript <sup>indicate the mumber of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</sup></P>
    
   <h5> Conclusion</h5>
    
   <P>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives</P>
